Intro to Rust Lang (98-008) is intended to provide an approachable introduction to the Rust programming language. We don't expect any previous exposure to the language, but we expect some previous background in C, equivalent to completing the course 15-122.

There will be weekly homeworks that are intended to take less than an hour each so that you have a chance to practice what we have taught in lecture for that week.

Please contact us with any questions or concerns, by Discord or by email. Thank you for your interest in our course!
