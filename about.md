Intro to Rust Lang (98-008) is intended to provide an approachable introduction to the Rust programming language. We don't expect any previous exposure to the language, but we expect some previous background in C, equivalent to completing the course 15-122.

<br>

There will be weekly homeworks that are intended to take around an hour each week so that you have a chance to practice what we have taught in lecture. See the [syllabus](https://rust-stuco.github.io/assets/pdf/syllabus-f25.pdf) for more information!

<br>

Please contact us with any questions or concerns, either through Piazza or directly via email. Thank you for your interest in our course!
